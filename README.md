# Let's go!

An immersive, introductory course to backend software engineering using [go](https://go.dev).

This course is split into two strands: workbooks to read, and projects to build. In the future, there will also be troubleshooting exercises to do, and potentially product-focused work.

You can view all of the projects in [the projects section](./projects), and all of the reading in [the primers section](./primers). We recommend following through both in parallel.

Don't worry about _all_ of the details in the primers - they're more intended as introductions to topics which you may want to reference back in the future as you run into specific issues. Trying to write code and solve the problems solved by topics in the primer will help you understand their contents a lot better.
