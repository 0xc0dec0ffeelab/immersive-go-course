# CLI & Files

In this project you're going to get familiar with the [Go programming language][go] by rebuilding two very common tools that programmers and computer administrators use all the time: [cat][cat] and [ls][ls].

Timebox: 4 days

Objectives:

- Install and use [cobra][cobra]
- Use go build/go install/go get etc
- Understand what a process is & the basics of process - lifecycle
- Accept arguments on the CLI
- Open, read (and close) files from CLI arguments
- Reading directories for files

## Instructions

You're going to build a command-line application that reads data the computers file system.

Let's say you have a few files containing poems in a directory:

- `dew.txt`
- `for_you.txt`
- `rain.txt`

The `ls` tool will list the files in that directory:

```
> ls
dew.txt
for_you.txt
rain.txt
```

While the `cat` command will output the contents of a file to you:

```
> cat dew.txt
“A World of Dew” by Kobayashi Issa

A world of dew,
And within every dewdrop
A world of struggle.
```

As you can see, `cat` takes an argument, namely the file to be written out. You'll learn how to do this too.

You're going to rebuild these two tools in Go:

```bash
> go-ls
dew.txt
for_you.txt
rain.txt

> go-cat dew.txt
“A World of Dew” by Kobayashi Issa

A world of dew,
And within every dewdrop
A world of struggle.
```
